"Consider the following sentence:
“This statement is false.”",6.913,3.958,65
Is that true?,10.871,1.292,65
"If so, that would make
this statement false.",12.163,2.375,70
"But if it’s false, then the statement 
is true.",14.538,2.291,65
"By referring to itself directly, this 
statement creates an unresolvable paradox.",16.829,5.292,65
"So if it’s not true and it’s not false—
what is it?",22.121,3.667,65
"This question might seem 
like a silly thought experiment.",26.288,2.875,65
"But in the early 20th century,
it led Austrian logician Kurt Gödel",29.163,4.666,65
"to a discovery that would change
mathematics forever.",33.829,3.417,65
"Gödel’s discovery had to do with 
the limitations of mathematical proofs.",37.746,4.541,65
"A proof is a logical argument
that demonstrates",42.496,3.166,65
why a statement about numbers is true.,45.662,2.5,65
"The building blocks of these arguments
are called axioms—",48.579,3.333,65
"undeniable statements 
about the numbers involved.",51.912,2.709,115
"Every system built on mathematics,",54.996,2.291,115
"from the most complex proof 
to basic arithmetic,",57.287,3.042,115
is constructed from axioms.,60.329,2.125,115
"And if a statement about numbers is true,",62.954,2.75,115
"mathematicians should be able to confirm
it with an axiomatic proof.",65.704,4.584,115
"Since ancient Greece, 
mathematicians used this system",70.788,3.208,115
"to prove or disprove mathematical claims
with total certainty.",73.996,4.208,115
"But when Gödel entered the field,",78.496,1.917,115
"some newly uncovered logical paradoxes
were threatening that certainty.",80.413,4.75,115
"Prominent mathematicians were eager
to prove",86.121,2.625,115
that mathematics had no contradictions.,88.746,2.542,115
Gödel himself wasn’t so sure.,91.496,2.375,115
"And he was even less confident
that mathematics was the right tool",93.871,4.25,115
to investigate this problem.,98.121,1.917,115
"While it’s relatively easy to create 
a self-referential paradox with words,",100.413,4.833,115
"numbers don't typically
talk about themselves.",105.246,3.25,115
"A mathematical statement is simply 
true or false.",108.829,3.209,115
But Gödel had an idea.,112.038,1.541,115
"First, he translated mathematical 
statements and equations into code numbers",114.038,4.833,115
"so that a complex mathematical idea could
be expressed in a single number.",118.871,4.292,115
"This meant that mathematical statements
written with those numbers",123.621,3.583,115
"were also expressing something about 
the encoded statements of mathematics.",127.204,4.459,115
"In this way, the coding allowed
mathematics to talk about itself.",132.288,4.125,115
"Through this method, he was able to write:",136.746,2.542,115
"“This statement cannot be proved” 
as an equation,",139.288,3.458,115
"creating the first self-referential
mathematical statement.",142.746,3.75,141
"However, unlike the ambiguous
sentence that inspired him,",147.413,3.5,115
"mathematical statements must be 
true or false.",150.913,3.458,115
So which is it?,154.579,1.5,115
"If it’s false, that means the statement
does have a proof.",156.371,3.542,115
"But if a mathematical statement has
a proof, then it must be true.",159.913,3.958,115
"This contradiction means that Gödel’s
statement can’t be false,",164.413,4.166,115
"and therefore it must be true that
“this statement cannot be proved.”",168.579,4.875,115
"Yet this result is even more surprising,",174.329,2.584,115
"because it means we now have 
a true equation of mathematics",176.913,4.083,115
that asserts it cannot be proved.,180.996,2.667,115
"This revelation is at the heart 
of Gödel’s Incompleteness Theorem,",184.121,4.75,115
"which introduces an entirely new class 
of mathematical statement.",188.871,4.25,141
"In Gödel’s paradigm, statements still 
are either true or false,",193.121,4.375,115
"but true statements can either be
provable or unprovable",197.621,4.542,115
within a given set of axioms.,202.163,2.375,115
"Furthermore, Gödel argues these 
unprovable true statements",204.746,4.708,115
exist in every axiomatic system.,209.454,2.917,115
This makes it impossible to create,212.788,2.208,115
"a perfectly complete system 
using mathematics,",214.996,3.333,115
"because there will always be true
statements we cannot prove.",218.329,4.042,115
"Even if you account for these
unprovable statements",222.704,2.667,115
"by adding them as new axioms 
to an enlarged mathematical system,",225.371,4.042,120
"that very process introduces new
unprovably true statements.",229.704,5.0,115
"No matter how many axioms you add,",235.121,2.292,115
"there will always be unprovably true 
statements in your system.",237.413,4.041,115
It’s Gödels all the way down!,241.454,2.167,115
"This revelation rocked the foundations 
of the field,",244.163,3.041,115
"crushing those who dreamed that every
mathematical claim would one day",247.204,4.125,115
be proven or disproven.,251.329,2.0,115
"While most mathematicians accepted this 
new reality, some fervently debated it.",253.788,4.916,115
"Others still tried to ignore 
the newly uncovered a hole",258.954,3.542,115
in the heart of their field.,262.496,1.875,115
"But as more classical problems were proven
to be unprovably true,",264.371,4.417,115
"some began to worry their life's work
would be impossible to complete.",268.788,4.625,115
"Still, Gödel’s theorem opened 
as many doors as a closed.",273.413,3.833,115
Knowledge of unprovably true statements,277.246,2.625,115
"inspired key innovations 
in early computers.",279.871,3.208,115
"And today, some mathematicians dedicate
their careers",283.329,3.084,115
"to identifying provably 
unprovable statements.",286.413,3.166,115
"So while mathematicians may have 
lost some certainty,",289.871,3.083,115
"thanks to Gödel they can embrace 
the unknown",292.954,2.792,115
at the heart of any quest for truth.,295.746,2.417,115
