"which introduces an entirely new class 
of mathematical statement.",0:03:08,4.25,141
"creating the first self-referential
mathematical statement.",0:02:22,3.75,141
"by adding them as new axioms 
to an enlarged mathematical system,",0:03:45,4.042,120
"In Gödel’s paradigm, statements still 
are either true or false,",0:03:13,4.375,115
"because there will always be true
statements we cannot prove.",0:03:38,4.042,115
"a perfectly complete system 
using mathematics,",0:03:34,3.333,115
This makes it impossible to create,0:03:32,2.208,115
exist in every axiomatic system.,0:03:29,2.917,115
"Furthermore, Gödel argues these 
unprovable true statements",0:03:24,4.708,115
within a given set of axioms.,0:03:22,2.375,115
"but true statements can either be
provable or unprovable",0:03:17,4.542,115
"mathematical statements must be 
true or false.",0:02:30,3.458,115
"This revelation is at the heart 
of Gödel’s Incompleteness Theorem,",0:03:04,4.75,115
that asserts it cannot be proved.,0:03:00,2.667,115
"because it means we now have 
a true equation of mathematics",0:02:56,4.083,115
"Yet this result is even more surprising,",0:02:54,2.584,115
"and therefore it must be true that
“this statement cannot be proved.”",0:02:48,4.875,115
"This contradiction means that Gödel’s
statement can’t be false,",0:02:44,4.166,115
"But if a mathematical statement has
a proof, then it must be true.",0:02:39,3.958,115
"Even if you account for these
unprovable statements",0:03:42,2.667,115
"that very process introduces new
unprovably true statements.",0:03:49,5.0,115
So which is it?,0:02:34,1.5,115
"No matter how many axioms you add,",0:03:55,2.292,115
"thanks to Gödel they can embrace 
the unknown",0:04:52,2.792,115
"So while mathematicians may have 
lost some certainty,",0:04:49,3.083,115
"to identifying provably 
unprovable statements.",0:04:46,3.166,115
"And today, some mathematicians dedicate
their careers",0:04:43,3.084,115
"inspired key innovations 
in early computers.",0:04:39,3.208,115
Knowledge of unprovably true statements,0:04:37,2.625,115
"Still, Gödel’s theorem opened 
as many doors as a closed.",0:04:33,3.833,115
"some began to worry their life's work
would be impossible to complete.",0:04:28,4.625,115
"But as more classical problems were proven
to be unprovably true,",0:04:24,4.417,115
in the heart of their field.,0:04:22,1.875,115
"Others still tried to ignore 
the newly uncovered a hole",0:04:18,3.542,115
"While most mathematicians accepted this 
new reality, some fervently debated it.",0:04:13,4.916,115
be proven or disproven.,0:04:11,2.0,115
"crushing those who dreamed that every
mathematical claim would one day",0:04:07,4.125,115
"This revelation rocked the foundations 
of the field,",0:04:04,3.041,115
It’s Gödels all the way down!,0:04:01,2.167,115
"there will always be unprovably true 
statements in your system.",0:03:57,4.041,115
"If it’s false, that means the statement
does have a proof.",0:02:36,3.542,115
at the heart of any quest for truth.,0:04:55,2.417,115
"to prove or disprove mathematical claims
with total certainty.",0:01:13,4.208,115
"And he was even less confident
that mathematics was the right tool",0:01:33,4.25,115
"undeniable statements 
about the numbers involved.",0:00:51,2.709,115
"Every system built on mathematics,",0:00:54,2.291,115
"from the most complex proof 
to basic arithmetic,",0:00:57,3.042,115
is constructed from axioms.,0:01:00,2.125,115
"And if a statement about numbers is true,",0:01:02,2.75,115
"mathematicians should be able to confirm
it with an axiomatic proof.",0:01:05,4.584,115
"Since ancient Greece, 
mathematicians used this system",0:01:10,3.208,115
"However, unlike the ambiguous
sentence that inspired him,",0:02:27,3.5,115
"But when Gödel entered the field,",0:01:18,1.917,115
"some newly uncovered logical paradoxes
were threatening that certainty.",0:01:20,4.75,115
"Prominent mathematicians were eager
to prove",0:01:26,2.625,115
Gödel himself wasn’t so sure.,0:01:31,2.375,115
that mathematics had no contradictions.,0:01:28,2.542,115
to investigate this problem.,0:01:38,1.917,115
"so that a complex mathematical idea could
be expressed in a single number.",0:01:58,4.292,115
"“This statement cannot be proved” 
as an equation,",0:02:19,3.458,115
"Through this method, he was able to write:",0:02:16,2.542,115
"In this way, the coding allowed
mathematics to talk about itself.",0:02:12,4.125,115
"This meant that mathematical statements
written with those numbers",0:02:03,3.583,115
"were also expressing something about 
the encoded statements of mathematics.",0:02:07,4.459,115
"First, he translated mathematical 
statements and equations into code numbers",0:01:54,4.833,115
But Gödel had an idea.,0:01:52,1.541,115
"A mathematical statement is simply 
true or false.",0:01:48,3.209,115
"numbers don't typically
talk about themselves.",0:01:45,3.25,115
"While it’s relatively easy to create 
a self-referential paradox with words,",0:01:40,4.833,115
"But in the early 20th century,
it led Austrian logician Kurt Gödel",0:00:29,4.666,65
"If so, that would make
this statement false.",0:00:12,2.375,65
"But if it’s false, then the statement 
is true.",0:00:14,2.291,65
"By referring to itself directly, this 
statement creates an unresolvable paradox.",0:00:16,5.292,65
"So if it’s not true and it’s not false—
what is it?",0:00:22,3.667,65
"This question might seem 
like a silly thought experiment.",0:00:26,2.875,65
Is that true?,0:00:10,1.292,65
"to a discovery that would change
mathematics forever.",0:00:33,3.417,65
"Gödel’s discovery had to do with 
the limitations of mathematical proofs.",0:00:37,4.541,65
"A proof is a logical argument
that demonstrates",0:00:42,3.166,65
why a statement about numbers is true.,0:00:45,2.5,65
"The building blocks of these arguments
are called axioms—",0:00:48,3.333,65
"Consider the following sentence:
“This statement is false.”",0:00:06,3.958,65
