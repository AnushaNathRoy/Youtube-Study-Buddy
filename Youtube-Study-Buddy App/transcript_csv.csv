in this video we're gonna focus on,0:00:00,6.98,50
matrices now what exactly is a matrix a,0:00:02,7.261,50
matrix is simply an array of numbers,0:00:07,6.33,50
organized into rows and columns and,0:00:09,6.09,50
first let's talk about the order of a,0:00:13,3.04,50
matrix,0:00:15,5.249,50
so consider matrix a and let's say it,0:00:16,12.379,50
has the numbers 2 7 negative 4 6 3 & 5,0:00:21,14.221,50
what is the order of this matrix now,0:00:28,19.301,50
this matrix has 2 rows and 3 columns now,0:00:35,14.85,50
the rows are horizontal so this is the,0:00:48,5.09,50
first row and this is the second row the,0:00:50,6.689,50
columns are vertical this is the first,0:00:53,8.199,50
column second third so there's two rows,0:00:56,7.351,50
and three columns so this is considered,0:01:01,7.471,50
a two by three matrix the order of the,0:01:04,8.76,50
matrix lists the rows first and then the,0:01:08,8.64,50
number of columns now you need to be,0:01:12,8.46,50
able to identify a specific element in a,0:01:17,9.239,50
matrix for example what is element 2,0:01:21,8.13,50
comma 3 or sometimes it can be written,0:01:26,7.621,50
as just element a 2 3 so this is in,0:01:29,9.48,50
matrix a and the first letter represents,0:01:34,9.17,50
the road the second letter is the column,0:01:38,7.32,50
so this is the first row this is the,0:01:43,5.5,50
second row this is the first column,0:01:46,6.18,50
second column third column so this,0:01:49,5.7,50
element number five is in the second row,0:01:52,5.969,50
third column so element a 2 3 has a,0:01:54,8.73,50
value of 5 now here's another one for,0:01:58,9.421,50
you what's element a 1 2 and also,0:02:03,9.21,50
element a 2 1 go ahead,0:02:07,7.25,50
and identify the value of these elements,0:02:12,5.67,50
so I limit a 1/2 that's in the first row,0:02:15,6.72,50
second column so that has a value of 7,0:02:18,6.81,50
element 81 is in the second row first,0:02:21,7.59,50
column and so that has a value of 6,0:02:25,7.23,50
let's consider another matrix so let's,0:02:29,5.65,50
say if we have matrix B and it has the,0:02:32,9.35,50
numbers 4 3 7 negative 2 5 6 negative,0:02:35,14.64,50
4/9 negative 3 8 1 and negative 7 what,0:02:41,12.16,50
is the order of the matrix so let's,0:02:49,6.72,50
start with the rows this is Row 1 Row 2,0:02:53,8.01,50
Row 3 and then the columns column 1 2 3,0:02:56,12.47,50
4 so the order of matrix being it's a 3,0:03:01,13.58,50
by 4 matrix it has 3 rows and 4 columns,0:03:08,6.57,50
now identify elements B 1 1 B 2 3 B 1 4,0:03:17,22.901,50
and B 3 4 go ahead and identify these,0:03:32,11.25,50
four elements so this one is in the,0:03:40,6.06,50
first row first column so that has a,0:03:43,7.95,50
value of 4 element B 2 3 that is in the,0:03:46,9.96,50
second row third column so that has a,0:03:51,9.39,50
value of negative 4 and then element B,0:03:56,9.75,50
run 4 is in the first row 4th column so,0:04:00,8.58,50
that's equal to negative 2 and element B,0:04:05,7.079,50
3 4 is in the third row fourth column so,0:04:09,6.84,50
it has the value of a negative 7 so you,0:04:12,5.821,50
need to be able to determine the order,0:04:16,5.879,50
of the matrix and the value of every or,0:04:18,6.84,50
any element in the matrix so what I'm,0:04:22,4.53,50
going to do at this point,0:04:25,2.49,50
I'm gonna give you a list of matrices,0:04:26,4.261,50
and I want you to identify the order of,0:04:28,6.209,50
each matrix so let's say if we have,0:04:30,5.879,50
matrix C and it has the numbers 3,0:04:34,6.18,50
negative 5 to negative 1,0:04:36,8.88,50
and then we have matrix D which contains,0:04:40,12.03,50
the elements for 5 negative 2 7 3 and,0:04:45,11.57,50
negative 6 and then we have matrix E,0:04:52,8.241,50
which contains one number which is eight,0:04:57,10.96,50
matrix F it's gonna have 7 4 negative 5,0:05:00,19.299,50
and 11 and let's say matrix G has the,0:05:08,21.48,50
numbers 3 1 7 2 6 negative for 9:03 so,0:05:20,15.481,50
identify the order of each matrix go,0:05:29,8.22,50
ahead and try that let me just give you,0:05:35,7.979,50
one more matrix H which is gonna be 2 1,0:05:37,12.921,50
7 negative 3 6 negative 2 5 and 4 and,0:05:43,10.521,50
also determine which of these matrices,0:05:50,6.699,50
represents a square matrix so let's,0:05:54,7.389,50
start with matrix C it has two rows and,0:05:57,8.611,50
it has two columns so therefore it's a 2,0:06:01,9.84,50
by 2 matrix now this is a square matrix,0:06:06,7.799,50
because the number of rows and columns,0:06:11,6.75,50
are the same in a square all sides are,0:06:13,9.0,50
the same now for matrix D we have 3 rows,0:06:18,9.781,50
and 2 columns so this is going to be,0:06:22,12.03,50
considered a 3 by 2 matrix so the order,0:06:27,9.209,50
of the matrix is always gonna be the,0:06:34,5.81,50
number of rows times the number of,0:06:37,3.74,50
now for matrix e it has one row and one,0:06:40,8.349,50
column so because it only has one number,0:06:45,10.6,50
it's a one by one matrix now for H there,0:06:49,13.53,50
are two rows and there's four columns so,0:06:56,12.479,50
this is a two by four matrix and then,0:07:02,10.98,50
for F we have one row and there's four,0:07:08,6.78,50
columns so that's a one by four matrix,0:07:13,5.971,50
and finally the last one gene that's,0:07:15,6.81,50
another score matrix as we can see,0:07:19,5.669,50
there's three ropes and it has three,0:07:22,5.731,50
columns so that's a three by three,0:07:25,5.85,50
matrix so now you know how to determine,0:07:27,5.459,50
the order of the matrix and you also,0:07:31,5.31,50
know how to identify the elements within,0:07:33,7.041,50
a matrix now let's focus on add in,0:07:36,6.84,50
matrices so let's say if we have matrix,0:07:40,7.359,50
a and it has the numbers two three five,0:07:43,10.07,50
negative 4 and we have matrix B which is,0:07:47,13.44,50
seven four negative three and five what,0:07:53,13.3,50
is the sum of matrix a and B so for add,0:08:01,8.341,50
in those two matrices all we need to do,0:08:06,7.17,50
is add the corresponding elements and by,0:08:09,7.009,50
the way if you have a two-by-two matrix,0:08:13,4.861,50
you can only add it to another,0:08:16,5.261,50
two-by-two matrix the number of rows and,0:08:18,5.25,50
columns must be the same when added,0:08:21,4.35,50
matrices or subtract the matrices as,0:08:23,6.599,50
well so the first element the one in the,0:08:26,6.899,50
first row first column we need to add it,0:08:30,6.06,50
with element b1 one in the first row in,0:08:33,6.721,50
the first column they have to match so,0:08:36,6.421,50
this is gonna be two plus seven and then,0:08:39,7.68,50
we need to add these two so in the first,0:08:43,5.97,50
row second column it's gonna be three,0:08:47,4.2,50
plus four and then we're gonna add those,0:08:48,4.31,50
two numbers,0:08:51,5.7,50
so that's gonna be five plus negative,0:08:53,7.39,50
three and these two numbers which are in,0:08:57,6.03,50
the second row second column the result,0:09:00,4.92,50
will remain in that position second row,0:09:03,9.39,50
second column now 2 plus 7 is 9 3 plus 4,0:09:05,12.36,50
is 7 5 plus negative 3 is 2 negative 4,0:09:12,9.99,50
plus 5 is 1 so this is the sum of matrix,0:09:17,7.47,50
a and B and that's a simple way to add,0:09:22,5.64,50
two matrices together it's not very,0:09:25,10.35,50
complicated now let's say if you want to,0:09:28,12.77,50
multiply matrix a by 4 what will you get,0:09:35,8.09,50
4 times a all you need to do is multiply,0:09:41,6.04,50
every element by 4 so it's gonna be 4,0:09:43,10.57,50
times 2 4 times 3 4 times 5 and 4 times,0:09:47,12.0,50
negative 4 so then for a it's gonna,0:09:54,17.04,50
equal 8 12 20 and negative 16 so what,0:09:59,15.36,50
about subtracting 2 matrices let's,0:10:11,7.41,50
subtract matrix a and B so we're gonna,0:10:14,6.6,50
start with a and then subtracted by B so,0:10:18,6.72,50
it's gonna be 2 minus 7 3 minus 4 5,0:10:21,8.37,50
minus negative 3 and then negative 4,0:10:25,8.67,50
minus 5 so a minus B that's gonna be 2,0:10:29,8.22,50
minus 7 which is negative 5 3 minus 4 is,0:10:34,6.96,50
negative 1 5 minus negative 3 or 5 plus,0:10:37,6.48,50
3 that's 8 negative 4 minus 5 is,0:10:41,5.81,50
negative 9 and so that's the difference,0:10:44,7.53,50
between the two matrices and that's it,0:10:47,6.64,50
